# Doctor Management System

## Overview
Doctor Management System is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the management of doctors, appointments, and patient records in a medical facility. The system is built using Django for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, React.js for the frontend with Material-UI components, and implements JWT authentication for secure access. Additionally, it includes a Progressive Web App (PWA) feature for offline access and patient email notifications for appointment reminders.

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule appointments for patients with available doctors and manage appointment times.
- **Patient Records**: Maintain detailed records of patients, including personal information, medical history, and visit summaries.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily search for doctors, patients, or appointments using filters and keywords.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login system for administrators and doctors to access the system.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Allows users to install the application on their devices and provides offline access.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email notifications to patients for appointment reminders.
